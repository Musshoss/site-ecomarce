        <h3>1. Eligibility for Exchange</h3>
        <br/>

        receiving their order. Exchanges can be made for another product,
        another color or another size. The product to be exchanged must be new,
        in its original packaging and in perfect condition, in the same
        condition as you received it, unworn or unused.

        methods: Phone: Call or text the phone number used to confirm your order
        or use the phone number displayed on product delivery slips. Social
        Media: Message us on our accounts @topboyswtrs or email us at

        <br/>
        <h3>3. Exchange Conditions Shipping Costs:</h3>
        <br/>
        The customer is responsible for all shipping costs associated with the
        exchange. No Refund Policy: All purchases are final and non-refundable.

        <br/>
        exchanges after the 48-hour period. If the requested product, size or
        color is not available, we will offer an alternative. We reserve the
        right to refuse an exchange if the product does not meet our return
        criteria. For any questions or further assistance, please feel free to
